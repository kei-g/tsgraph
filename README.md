## Usage

### tsgraph-generate

`tsgraph-generate` generates a random graph, and its picture.

| option | long | short | type | default value | description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| --image | --image-path | -i | string | 'tsgraph.png' | a file path to store picture |
| --json | --json-path | -j | string | 'tsgraph.json' | a file path to store graph |
| --nodes | --number-of-nodes | -n | integer | 65536 | a number of nodes to generate |
| --size | --image-size | -s | integer | 8192 | a resolution of the picture <br> this means width and height |
| --threads | --number-of-threads | -t | integer | 16 | a number of threads to generate links concurrently |

### tsgraph-solve

`tsgraph-solve` solves the shortest path between randomly selected two nodes in a graph which is typically generated by `tsgraph-generate`

| option | long | short | type | default value | description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| --dest | --destination | -d | string | 'tsgraph{0-}.png' | a file path to save picture <br> if this option was omitted, the path is suggested such as 'tsgraph0.png', 'tsgraph1.png', ... |
| --json | | -j | string | 'tsgraph.json' | a file path of graph to solve |
| --src | --source | -s | string | 'tsgraph.png' | a file path to a picture of the graph to solve |
